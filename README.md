## Description

Conditional Flow Matching is a fast way to train Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) models. CFM is a simulation-free training objective for continuous normalizing flows that allows conditional generative modeling and speeds up training and inference. See [this http link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00482) for the preprint.

Under this general framework we introduce Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM). OT-CFM creates dynamical optimal transport flows between marginal distributions by introducing an optimal transport condition.

## Examples

The density, vector field, and trajectories of simulation-free CNF training schemes. The first two methods variance preserving SDE (VP-SDE) and Flow Matching (FM) require a gaussian source distribution so do not appear in the above example mapping 8 Gaussians to the two moons dataset. Training action matching with the same architecture (3x64 MLP with SeLU activations) underfits however, with a Relu SiLU and SiLU activations as suggested in the [example code](https://github.com/necludov/jam) it seems to fit better under our training setup (Action-Matching (Swish). The models to produce the GIF are stored in `notebooks/models` and can be visualized with this [![notebook](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Run%20in&message=Google%20Colab&color=orange&logo=Google%20Cloud)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/atong01/conditional-flow-matching/blob/master/notebooks/model-comparison-plotting.ipynb).

## Code Contributions

This repo is extracted from a larger private codebase which loses the original commit history which contains work from other authors on the paper.

## How to run

Run a simple minimal example here [![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Run%20in&message=Google%20Colab&color=orange&logo=Google%20Cloud)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/atong01/conditional-flow-matching/blob/master/notebooks/training-8gaussians-to-moons.ipynb). Or install the more efficient code locally with these steps.

Install dependencies

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching.git
cd conditional-flow-matching

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv

# install pytorch according to instructions
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train model with default configuration

```bash
# train on CPU
python src/train.py trainer=cpu

# train on GPU
python src/train.py trainer=gpu
```

Train model with chosen experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/)

```bash
python src/train.py experiment=experiment_name
```

You can override any parameter from command line like this

```bash
python src/train.py trainer.max_epochs=20 datamodule.batch_size=64
```

You can also train a large set of models in parallel with SLURM as shown in `scripts/two-dim-cfm.sh` which trains the models used in the first 3 lines of Table 2.

> **Note**: Hydra composes configs lazily at job launch time. If you change code or configs after launching a job/sweep, the final composed configs might be impacted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Create a sweep over hyperparameters with Optuna</b></summary>

```bash
# this will run hyperparameter search defined in `configs/hparams_search/mnist_optuna.yaml`
# over chosen experiment config
python train.py -m hparams_search=mnist_optuna experiment=example
```

> **Note**: Using [Optuna Sweeper](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/optuna_sweeper) doesn't require you to add any boilerplate to your code, everything is defined in a [single config file](configs/hparams_search/mnist_optuna.yaml).

> **Warning**: Optuna sweeps are not failure-resistant (if one job crashes then the whole sweep crashes).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Execute all experiments from folder</b></summary>

```bash
python train.py -m 'experiment=glob(*)'
```

> **Note**: Hydra provides special syntax for controlling behavior of multiruns. Learn more [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/multi-run). The command above executes all experiments from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Execute run for multiple different seeds</b></summary>

```bash
python train.py -m seed=1,2,3,4,5 trainer.deterministic=True logger=csv tags=["benchmark"]
```

> **Note**: `trainer.deterministic=True` makes pytorch more deterministic but impacts the performance.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Execute sweep on a remote AWS cluster</b></summary>

> **Note**: This should be achievable with simple config using [Ray AWS launcher for Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/ray_launcher). Example is not implemented in this template.

</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary><b>Execute sweep on a SLURM cluster</b></summary>

> This should be achievable with either [the right lightning trainer flags](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clouds/cluster.html?highlight=SLURM#slurm-managed-cluster) or simple config using [Submitit launcher for Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/submitit_launcher). Example is not yet implemented in this template.

</details> -->

<details>
<summary><b>Use Hydra tab completion</b></summary>

> **Note**: Hydra allows you to autocomplete config argument overrides in shell as you write them, by pressing `tab` key. Read the [docs](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/tab_completion).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Apply pre-commit hooks</b></summary>

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

> **Note**: Apply pre-commit hooks to do things like auto-formatting code and configs, performing code analysis or removing output from jupyter notebooks. See [# Best Practices](#best-practices) for more.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Run tests</b></summary>

```bash
# run all tests
pytest

# run tests from specific file
pytest tests/test_train.py

# run all tests except the ones marked as slow
pytest -k "not slow"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Use tags</b></summary>

Each experiment should be tagged in order to easily filter them across files or in logger UI:

```bash
python train.py tags=["mnist","experiment_X"]
```

If no tags are provided, you will be asked to input them from command line:

```bash
>>> python train.py tags=[]
[2022-07-11 15:40:09,358][src.utils.utils][INFO] - Enforcing tags! <cfg.extras.enforce_tags=True>
[2022-07-11 15:40:09,359][src.utils.rich_utils][WARNING] - No tags provided in config. Prompting user to input tags...
Enter a list of comma separated tags (dev):
```

If no tags are provided for multirun, an error will be raised:

```bash
>>> python train.py -m +x=1,2,3 tags=[]
ValueError: Specify tags before launching a multirun!
```

> **Note**: Appending lists from command line is currently not supported in hydra :(
